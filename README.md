# CKD-Prediction
This project is aimed at predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD) using machine learning algorithms. The model is built and tested using Python, and the front end is created using Streamlit for easy interaction. The machine learning model is trained using Google Collab, and the project is organized using Anaconda to manage the environment.
