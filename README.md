# CKD-Prediction
This project is aimed at predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD) using machine learning algorithms.
The model is built and tested using Python, and the front end is created using Streamlit for easy interaction.
The machine learning model is trained using Google Collab, and the project is organized using Anaconda to manage the environment.

#Instructions for Running the Project:

Step 1:  
Install Anaconda if not already installed.
Set up Anaconda Environment and activate. 

Step 2:
Install Required Libraries.
pip install streamlit scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib.

Step 3: Download the Repository Files
download the repository containing the project files from GitHub.

Step 4: Run Streamlit App
Open the terminal/command prompt in the project environment in the anaconda.

Copy code: streamlit run app.py(include your path like given in the txt file)

Step 5: 
Test the Model.
use the data sets provided in the  (sample data sets).
